# pi-web-api-aspnet-search
This ASP.NET MVC application allows user to enter a search query and perform a search for a selected category using the PI Web API Indexed Search.

##Getting Started
You can obtain the Visual Studio 2015 solution and the associated files from the [PI-Web-API-Samples/CSharp/pi-web-api-cs-helper](./) folder. The code was tested with PI Web API 2015 R2. You will need a working instance of PI Web API server, with the [PI Indexed Search feature](https://livelibrary.osisoft.com/LiveLibrary/content/en/web-api-v2/GUID-78EA0D36-5BDD-4F40-99FB-6D48D62B15DA) installed. You will need to set up the search crawler to index the PI Data Archive and/or the AF Database. For more information on how to set up the search, please refer to our PI Live Library documentation [here](https://livelibrary.osisoft.com/LiveLibrary/content/en/web-api-v2/GUID-D847876F-A9A3-4089-89C8-5205FBCF9198#addHistory=true&filename=GUID-16B3943B-0F1C-4BAF-94B0-0872AB00F797.xml&docid=GUID-16B3943B-0F1C-4BAF-94B0-0872AB00F797&inner_id=&tid=&query=&scope=&resource=&toc=false&eventType=lcContent.loadDocGUID-16B3943B-0F1C-4BAF-94B0-0872AB00F797). Note that you need to use Kerberos authentication in order to generate new indices.

In your own environment, change the PI Web API endpoint at https://myserver/piwebapi/search/quaery?q= by replacing myserver with the name of your PI Web API instance (in the HomeController.cs file in the Controllers folder).

##How does the Application Work?
On the main page of this application, users have the opportunity to enter a search string, select a search category, and the maximum number of results returned. The application makes a HTTP GET request to the PI Web API server at the search/query endpoint ([Search controller > Query action](https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Documentation/PI-Web-API/help/controllers/search/actions/query.html)), the server then return the name, item type (e.g. PI Point, AF Element), as well as the WebId to the client and the information is displayed in a table. 

##Implementation Details
Communication to the PI Web API is made via the .NET HttpClient. We built a wrapper around the HttpClient (see PIWebAPIClien.cs file in the Helpers folder). Detail implementation and description of the helper part of the project can be found in the first part of the [blog post] (https://pisquare.osisoft.com/community/developers-club/blog/2015/08/11/working-with-pi-web-api-httpclient-in-c) in PI Developers Club. More information about the helper can also be found in another project in this repository (see [pi-web-api-cs-helper](../../CSharp/pi-web-api-cs-helper)).

In the Home controller, we populate the dropdown list to show the search categories that users can select from. 

When users post to the Search action in the Home controller, the PI Web API url endpoint was constructed based on the user-entered information:
```
string url = "https://myserver/piwebapi/search/query?q=";
if (!model.Option.Equals("all"))
{
    url += model.Option + ":" + model.Query;
}
else
{
    url += model.Query;
}
url += "&count=" + model.Count + "&fields=name;itemtype;webid";
```

We then call the GetAsync method in the PIWebAPIClient wrapper to submit a GET request to the url:
```
PIWebAPIClient client = new PIWebAPIClient();
JObject jobj = await client.GetAsync(url);
```
Note that we are using Kerberos authentication to connect to PI Web API. As of PI Web API 2015 R2, the PI Web API Indexed Search will only crawl when Kerberos authentication is configured. You can, however, search for crawled indices using basic authentication.

From the HTTP response, we loop through the items collection and add each result to the SearchResult model:
```
List<SearchResult> results = new List<SearchResult>();
for (int i = 0; i < jobj["Items"].Count(); i++)
{
    SearchResult result = new SearchResult();
    result.Name = jobj["Items"][i]["Name"].ToString();
    result.ItemType = jobj["Items"][i]["ItemType"].ToString();
    result.WebId = jobj["Items"][i]["WebID"].ToString();
    results.Add(result);
}
```

The SearchResult is then passed to the Search view to render the results on the page.
